# Walkbox

Find walking routes anywhere in the world (OpenStreetMap), add them to your own
searchable box, and download each one as a GPX file.

- **Find walks**: type a place or pan the map, press "Find walks in this map view", tick walks, press "Add selected to my box".
- **My walk box**: search by name, ref, operator or place, filter by distance, download one walk as GPX or everything as a .zip.

Route data © OpenStreetMap contributors (ODbL). Downloaded GPX files carry this notice.

## Deploy on the Synology (Dockhand)

GitHub Actions builds the image on every push to `main` and publishes it to `ghcr.io/deepakgaur84/walkbox`.
The NAS only pulls that image, so no code folder and no `git` on the NAS are needed.

1. One time, GitHub: after the first build finishes (repo > Actions tab shows a green tick), open your profile > Packages > `walkbox` >
   Package settings > Change visibility > Public. This lets the NAS pull it without a login.
2. File Station: create the folder `docker/walkbox/data` (the database lives here), or extract the deploy zip that already contains it.
3. Dockhand: create a stack named `walkbox`, paste in `docker-compose.yml` from this repo, and deploy.
4. In Zoraxy, add a proxy rule for your hostname with target `walkbox:8080` (container name and internal port; TLS off).
   Walkbox joins the existing `proxynet` Docker network and publishes no host port.
   There is no login, so enable authentication/access control on the proxy rule.

To update after code changes: push to `main`, wait for the green tick on the Actions tab, then redeploy the stack in Dockhand with "pull latest image".
